This repository contains various examples using [Tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/javascript).

1. **tf-sequential-test-1:** Simple sequential model following [Tensorflow Tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tfjs-training-regression).
2. **tf-sequential-test-2:** Single file version of [Reinforcement Learning with Cart-Pole](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/cart-pole).
3. **tf-sequential-test-3:** Simplified version of *tf-sequential-test-2*, starts training directly using the values in *myStart()*.
4. **tf-sequential-test-4:** Follows *tf-sequential-test-3*, with support for 2 actions (separate right and left forces, no force on the cart if both are true simultaneously) and more reward while the cart is closer to the center of the space.
